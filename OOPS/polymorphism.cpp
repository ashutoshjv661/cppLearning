/*
    Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming. 
    Polymorphism is a concept that allows you to perform a single action in different ways.
     Polymorphism is the combination of two Greek words. 
     The poly means many, and morphs means forms. So polymorphism means many forms. 
     Letâ€™s understand polymorphism with a real-life example. Real-life example:  
     A person at the same time can have different characteristics. 
     Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, and an employee. 
     So the same person possesses different behavior in different situations. 
     This is called polymorphism.
